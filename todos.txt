1. Examine the dataset API to create a dataset, the dataset you will create will probably use the
tf.data.Dataset.from_generator call. Maybe even use interleave.
For performance enhancements consider using a number of threads and also the prefetch call. For more information please
refer to the Hands-On machine learning book and also for the following links:
what is a generator - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do
from_generator and on creating datasets in tf - https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset

You should consider using the following functions offered by tf.data.Dataset
	a. from_generator
	b. shuffle
	c. repeat
	d. batch
	e. prefetch
All of which are a dataset methods and returns a dataset.

**Note** no preprocessing is currently needed, but if in the future a preprocessing step will be needed, the handling
should be changed.



2. After building the dataset please test that it truly returns what you intended it to return. You can iterate on the
dataset simply by a for loop. E.g.,
for item in dataset



3. Consider saving checkpoints of the model, please refer to the book for more information.



4. Please fix tenorflow-gpu, for now the things you should do is as follows:
	a. Install NVIDIA Quadro P620 driver, could ve found in the downloads. But to do so, first you need to take care of
	nvidia-drm and some others. For more information please refer to:
	https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/440840/how-to-unload-kernel-module-nvidia-drm
	Before entering the text consule please understand what it is first.

	b. All the following steps should be given in this link:
